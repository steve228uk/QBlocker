# QBlocker

QBlocker stops you from accidentally quitting an app when you actually meant to close the window. It works by blocking the default CMD + Q keyboard shortcut and forcing you to hold it down to quit.

## Download

Grab the [latest stable version here](https://dl.devmate.com/uk.co.wearecocoon.QBlocker/QBlocker.dmg) or download a version from the Github releases page.

## Contributing
